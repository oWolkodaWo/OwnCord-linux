# TODOS

Deferred work items from engineering reviews.

## Completed (2026-03-29 voice/video polish pass)

- ~~Voice E2E Test Infrastructure~~ -- `tests/e2e/voice-lifecycle.spec.ts` (11 tests)
- ~~Voice Session Metrics~~ -- `voice_sessions` counter on `/api/v1/metrics`
- ~~Create DESIGN.md~~ -- full design system documentation at repo root
- ~~Extract AudioPipeline Class~~ -- `audioPipeline.ts`, `audioElements.ts`, `deviceManager.ts` (facade pattern)
- ~~Audio Pipeline + Event Handler Tests~~ -- `audio-pipeline.test.ts` (30 tests), `audio-elements.test.ts` (25 tests)
- ~~HTTPS Proxy Unit Tests~~ -- `livekit_proxy_test.go` (22 tests)
- ~~Migrate VAD to AudioWorklet~~ -- `public/vad-worklet.js` with setTimeout fallback

## Already Implemented (discovered 2026-03-29 — code analysis was stale)

- ~~Simulcast on Camera Video~~ -- `simulcast: quality !== "source"` in publishTrack options (livekitSession.ts:852)
- ~~Adaptive Bitrate on Screenshare~~ -- `dynacast: !isSource` + `adaptiveStream: !isSource` in Room options (livekitSession.ts:187-188)
- ~~LiveKit Proxy Port Exhaustion~~ -- already handles reuse (same host) + cleanup via shutdown channel (different host) in livekit_proxy.rs:196-208

## Deferred (from 2026-03-29 CEO review)

### Voice E2E CI Integration (narrowed scope)

**What:** Set up LiveKit binary in CI for WebRTC-specific regression testing only.
**Why:** Mocked E2E tests (24 tests in `voice-lifecycle.spec.ts`) cover 90%+ of voice UI regressions. Real LiveKit CI is only needed for audio pipeline bugs, LiveKit SDK regressions, or WebRTC transport issues that mocks can't catch.
**Pros:** Catches WebRTC-specific regressions (codec negotiation, ICE failures, audio pipeline).
**Cons:** Requires Docker-in-CI setup with LiveKit binary. High maintenance for low-frequency bugs.
**Context:** Mocked voice E2E covers: join/leave flow, speaker indicators, permission recovery, device hot-swap, quality warnings, timer, token refresh, channel switching. Only pursue real LiveKit CI if evidence emerges of WebRTC-specific regressions that mocked tests miss.
**Depends on:** Voice E2E test infrastructure (done), mocked voice E2E expansion (done).
**Added:** 2026-03-29 (eng review of voice/video polish), **updated:** 2026-03-29 (scope narrowed after mocked E2E expansion)
**Added:** 2026-03-29 (eng review of voice/video polish)
