- [x] **T-183:** Fix BUG-056 — fix livekit-session.test.ts proxy URL test (mock Tauri invoke) — 2026-03-28

## Refactoring

- [x] **T-184:** Refactor `livekitSession.ts` — remove duplicate audio pipeline fields/methods, delegate entirely to `_audioPipeline`. 1,438 → 1,171 lines (267 lines removed) — 2026-03-29
- [x] **T-185:** Add unit tests for delete account UI flow in `settings-overlay.test.ts` — 7 tests: trigger, cancel, password validation, callback, disabled state, error display, input clearing — 2026-03-29

## Code Quality — Found 2026-03-29 (full-project audit)

## 2FA Client Integration — 2026-03-29

### High Priority

- [x] **T-192:** Client 2FA enrollment/disable settings UI — AccountTab TOTP section, auth store state, SettingsOverlay wiring — 2026-03-29
- [x] **T-193:** Client 2FA test coverage — Unit tests for TOTP settings flows, api.ts TOTP methods, auth store totp_enabled state — 2026-03-29
- [x] **T-194:** Full regression validation pass — `go test ./...`, `npm test`, `golangci-lint`, `npm run lint` — 2026-03-29

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **T-195:** User profile/password/session management endpoints — PATCH /users/me, PUT /users/me/password, GET/DELETE /users/me/sessions (server-side)
- [ ] **T-196:** DM sidebar incremental DOM update — Replace full DOM rebuild at SidebarArea.ts:753 with reconciliation

## Bugs — 2026-03-29

### High Priority

- [ ] **T-202:** Admin panel tab navigation broken — Clicking Audit Logs, Members, or other tabs in the `/admin` panel does not switch pages. Likely regression from recent `handlers_settings.go` or `logstream.go` changes. Investigate JS console errors and admin static files.

## Code Review Findings — 2026-03-29

### High Priority

- [ ] **T-197:** Fix double `updateUser` call on TOTP confirm/disable — Remove duplicate `updateUser({ totp_enabled })` from MainPage.ts callbacks; AccountTab.ts already handles it via onEnrolled/onDisabled
- [ ] **T-198:** Add TOTP audit log events — `handleVerifyTOTP`, `handleConfirmTOTP`, `handleDisableTOTP` produce no audit entries; add `database.LogAudit(...)` calls for totp_verified, totp_enabled, totp_disabled
- [ ] **T-199:** Safe default for `registration_open` on upgrade — New enforcement in `handleRegister` breaks existing servers with no `registration_open` DB row; `getBooleanSetting` should default to `true` or add a migration seeding the row
- [ ] **T-200:** Extract TOTP handlers to `totp_handler.go` — `auth_handler.go` at 829 lines exceeds 800-line convention; move TOTP handlers + helpers to dedicated file

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **T-201:** TOTP constant-time code comparison — `totp.go:207` uses `==` for code comparison; use `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` for defense-in-depth

- [x] **T-161:** Relocate MemberList into unified sidebar as collapsible section — SidebarArea.ts:625-743, with resize handle and localStorage persistence — verified 2026-03-29
- [x] **T-162:** Wire DM conversations to real data source — SidebarArea.ts:408-419 reads from dmStore, renders with status/unread/timestamps — verified 2026-03-29
- [x] **T-163:** Wire quick-switch overlay disconnect/reconnect flow — SidebarArea.ts:844-850, stores target in sessionStorage, calls clearAuth() — verified 2026-03-29
- [x] **T-164:** Add per-server collapsible section state persistence to localStorage — ui.store.ts:124-176, keyed by server hostname — verified 2026-03-29
